# hour-tracker-electron
Hour tracking for contract work made in electron. VERY VERY sketchy right now, don't recommend unless you want a supreme headache

### For development

For the main app:

The usual `git clone $URL $DIRECTORY` and `yarn || npm install` then `yarn || npm start`.

For the express server (will be more important after it actually _does_ something ;) ):

`cd $DIRECTORY/server` then `yarn || npm install` followed by `yarn || npm start`.

### For releases

No releases yet, should be easy-to-use packages though (i.e. `.exe`, `.dmg`, `.deb or .rpm`). Give the project a watch on Github if you want to wai for a release.
