# hour-tracker-electron
Hour tracking for contract work, made in electron. Mostly designed as a test-project, but I'll be using it personally to track my own projects instead of paying for other ones. **VERY VERY** sketchy right now, don't recommend unless you want a supreme headache ;)

### For development

For the main app:

The usual `git clone $URL $DIRECTORY` and `yarn || npm install` then `yarn || npm start`.

For the express server (will be more important after it actually _does_ something ;) ):

`cd $DIRECTORY/server` then `yarn || npm install` followed by `yarn || npm start`.

### For releases

No releases yet, should be easy-to-use packages though (i.e. `.exe`, `.dmg`, `.deb or .rpm`). Give the project a watch on Github if you want to wait for a release.
